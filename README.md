# Mini Project | Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Development

### Overview
In this activity, students will work in pairs to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. This project will help them apply their programming skills while reinforcing concepts like functions, conditionals, and loops. Students will start by developing their game in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for easy testing and iteration, and they will have the option to convert their notebook into a Python script later.

## Context

This project is designed as a one-day exercise where each **pair of students** will conceptualize, develop, and test their Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The activity will be structured into several steps to guide students through the development process.

### Activity Steps

#### Step 1: Project Setup
- **Choose Your Tools**: Students will set up their development environment using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Create a New Notebook**: Name it `rock_paper_scissors.ipynb`.

#### Step 2: Define Game Rules
- **Outline the Game Logic**: Discuss the rules of the game:
  - The player can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
  - The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
  - Determine the winner based on the rules:
    - Rock crushes Scissors
    - Scissors cuts Paper
    - Paper covers Rock

#### Step 3: Implement the Game in Notebook
- **Coding the Game**:
  1. **Import Required Libraries**: Use the `random` library to allow the computer to make random choices.
  2. **Define Functions**:
     - Create a function to get the player's choice.
     - Create a function to get the computer's choice.
     - Create a function to determine the winner based on player and computer choices.
  3. **Game Loop**: Implement a loop that allows players to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit.

#### Step 4: Testing and Debugging

- **Play & Test**: Pairs should run their game in the notebook to ensure it works as expected. They should check for any bugs or logical errors and fix them.

#### Step 5: Optional Enhancements
- **Extra Features** (Optional): Students are encouraged to add additional features such as:
  - Keeping score of wins, losses, and ties.
  - Adding a user interface using libraries like `tkinter` (for advanced students).

#### Step 6: Convert Notebook to Script (Optional)
- After completing their game in Jupyter Notebook, pairs can convert their notebook into a Python script (`rock_paper_scissors.py`) if they choose. This step is optional and can serve as an additional learning experience on how to structure code for scripts.

### Project Submission
- **Final Code Submission**: Each pair will submit their completed Jupyter Notebook (`rock_paper_scissors.ipynb`) along with any additional features they implemented. If they converted their notebook to a script, they should include that file as well.
- **Documentation**: Include comments in the code explaining key parts of the implementation and any challenges faced during development.
- Submit the link to pull request in Student Portal.

### Individual Reflections
- After completing their projects, each student will share feedback in brief about 1-2 minutes each.
- The reflection, you should try to address each of the below:
    - What they enjoyed most about working on the project.
    - Any challenges they encountered and how they overcame them.
    - Key programming concepts they learned through this exercise.
